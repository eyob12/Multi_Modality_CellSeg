# Multi-Modality Cell Segmentation 
A universal cell segmentation model designed to accurately segment cells of varying shapes across a wide range of multimodality microscopic images, including brightfield, fluorescent, phase contrast (PC), and differential interference contrast (DIC) modalities.

This repository contains the implementation of a novel Multi-Modality Cell Segmentation framework.
## Code Availability
The source code for this repository will be made publicly available upon the acceptance of the associated research paper. Stay tuned for updates!
